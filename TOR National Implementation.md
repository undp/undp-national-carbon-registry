The following work steps are for the TOR for national implementation of the carbon registry in any country:

- Installation of a Carbon Registry from https://github.com/undp/carbon-registry

- Initial Setup of the Carbon Registry, including localization to national requirements:
	- translation into relevant national languages *(Link to the .json/yaml files that need translation HERE)*
	- adjust sectors to match the sectors specified in the nationally determined contribution *(link to file that specifies sectors HERE)*
	- integration with existing NDC management tools (if applicable)
	- adjustment of user types to national requirements
	- creation of government accounts
*(Deliverable: Fully localized Carbon Registry running on test environment)*
 
- Successful end-to-end test of the registry. This test needs to cover the full lifecycle of one dummy project including at least project creation, authorization, implementation, MRV, issuance and transfer. 
*(Deliverable: Test Report)*
- Creation of a nationally appropriate signup proceedure for non-government accounts
- Hand over to official government use
*(Deliverable: Government Acceptance)*

- Long term hosting and DevOps of the registry


The TOR can be further specified if national details are known, e.g. about the NDC management tool. 
These worksteps can also be intergrated with larger TORs, especially TORs covering wider NDC management / transparency.
