# Sample Terms of Reference
The TOR can be further specified if national details are known, e.g. about the NDC management tool. 
These worksteps can also be intergrated with larger TORs, especially TORs covering wider NDC management / transparency. Below are sample phrases that may be used. Generally a vendor (firm) or a group of individual consultant are encouraged, as the required skills vary. 

## 1. Installation
The following work steps are suggested for the national implementation of the DPG carbon registry in any country.

- Installation of a Carbon Registry from https://github.com/undp/carbon-registry

- Technical timeline/roadmap
- Fork the [Carbon Registry](https://github.com/undp/carbon-registry). Send pull requests to `staging` for added features (languages, security patchees, modules, etc.). 

- Initial Setup of the Carbon Registry, including localization to national requirements:
	- translation of text into relevant national languages
	- adjust colors, logos, maps, etc. to national standard
	- design graphics
	- purchase domain, hosting, & security certificate
	- register & connect supporting services (analytics, forms, etc.)
	- adjust sectors to match the sectors specified in the nationally determined contribution 
	- integration with existing NDC management tools (if applicable) [API]
	- adjustment of user types to national requirements
	- creation of government accounts
	- status page for monitoring uptime, utlizing https://github.com/undp/carbon-registry-status 
	- *(Deliverable: Fully localized Carbon Registry running on staging (test) environment & productive (live) environment)*
 
- Build carbon credit calculators for locally-determined sectors & according to local regulations. Referencing https://github.com/undp/carbon-registry/tree/main/libs/carbon-credit-calculator . Push new calculators to main codebase.
- [Optional] Creation of new features / modules. Reporting update on https://github.com/undp/carbon-registry/tree/main/modules.
- - Successful end-to-end test of the registry. This test needs to cover the full lifecycle of one dummy project including at least project creation, authorization, implementation, MRV, issuance and transfer. 
*(Deliverable: Test Report)*
- Creation of a nationally appropriate signup proceedure for non-government accounts
- Hand over to official government use
*(Deliverable: Government Acceptance. Source code submission (ideally on `GitHub`) approved.)*
- Testing: Security, Privacy, Accessibility, Performance, Load. *(Deliverable: 3rd party and/or automated tests.)*
- Ticketing system: For submitting, tracking, & responding to platform requests & bugs.
- Warranty: Supporting long term web hosting and operation (DevOps) of the registry
- Training: interactive tutorial. manual. video/screen recording walkthrough. guidebook. workshops. help page. chatbot.
- Awareness: advertising. community outreach.

Other items to consider:
- Hosting / clound server:
- 	The ToR is based on the assumption that he government entity has or will prepare a hosting environment in a cloud server. If the government does not have a server space, consider if the vendor will need to host the registry. If so, consider if the vendor can be contracted for a long term. 
- 	Server specifications: TBD
