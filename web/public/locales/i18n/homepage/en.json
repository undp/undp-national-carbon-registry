  "policyContextBody": "Carbon markets are trading systems in which carbon credits are sold and bought. Companies or individuals can use carbon markets to compensate for their greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits from entities that remove or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There are broadly two types of carbon markets: compliance and voluntary. If held to high standards of integrity and transparency, carbon markets can help accelerate the transformation needed, by effectively putting a price on pollution and creating an economic incentive for reducing emissions.<br/><br/>Article 6 of the Paris Agreement establishes the framework for countries to cooperate in meeting their climate goals through market-based and non-market approaches. Specifically, Article 6.2 allows countries to trade emission reductions and removals with one another through bilateral or multilateral agreements. These traded credits are called Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs).  Article 6.2 sets specific requirements for participating Parties in terms of tracking and reporting:<ul><li><b>decision 2/CMA.3 (paragraph 29):</b> “Each participating Party shall have, or have access to, a registry for the purpose of tracking ...”.</li><li><b>decision 2/CMA.3 (paragraph 20):</b> “Each participating Party shall, on an annual basis by no later than 15 April of the following year and in an agreed electronic format, submit for recording in the Article 6 database ...”</li></ul>Although other setups are possible, like using existing registries, many countries opt to establish national carbon registries to both meet Article 6.2 obligations and maintain broader sovereign oversight of domestic carbon market activities.",

  "digitalPublicBody": "Drawing on its experience in supporting countries with carbon market readiness, and in response to global need, UNDP has developed the open-source National Carbon Credit Registry—a scalable and interoperable solution that enables countries to establish sovereign national registries.The Registry was developed based on the <a1>Digital Public Goods Standard</a1>. Countries can access the free, open-source code and installation instructions <a2>from UNDP’s managed Github</a2> to customize a Registry according to their national needs. This approach helps save time, reduce costs, and avoids duplication of effort.",

  "faqTitle": "FAQ - Common questions: ",
  "faqQ1": "What is a National Carbon Registry?",
  "faqA1": "A National Carbon Registry is a secure digital platform used by governments to track, manage, and regulate carbon credits within their national carbon markets.",
  "faqQ2": "How does a government adopt a National Carbon Registry?",
  "faqA2": "Governments can adopt and customize the open-source National Carbon Registry to meet their specific needs. By building on UNDP’s open-source codebase, countriescan reduce development time and costs by up to 70%.<br /><br />To implement the Registry nationally, countries should have:<ul><li>A defined Carbon Market Framework</li><li>A full-stack digital team, with expertise in:<ul><li>UX/UI design</li><li>Backend and frontend development</li><li>DevOps and system administration</li><li>Cybersecurity</li></ul></li><li>Essential IT infrastructure, including:<ul><li>Server space (cloud, local, or blockchain-based)</li><li>SSL/TLS certificates for encrypted communication</li><li>A secure domain name (e.g., HTTPS with trusted CA)</li><li>Firewalls and intrusion detection systems</li><li>Role-based access control (RBAC)</li><li>Data encryption (at rest and in transit)</li><li>Regular security audits and penetration testing</li><li>Backup and disaster recovery protocols</li></ul></li><li>An Implementation Task Force: A cross-functional team of policy and IT representatives to lead deployment</li><li>A designated Project Owner</li><li>A long-term maintenance plan, with a dedicated IT budget</li></ul>",
  "faqQ3": "If we use the open-source code, does that mean all data on the Registry is open?",
  "faqA3": "No. The open-source code is publicly available, as a starting point to help countries adapt and build their own national Registries. All country-specific registries and data, once built, are hosted and secured by each government. Each country is responsible for managing its own system in line with national data protection laws. Data access and sharing are entirely up to each government.",
  "faqQ4": "Will the UNDP own and manage my country’s National Carbon Registry?",
  "faqA4": "No. Each National Carbon Registry is fully sovereign. Each government is responsible for the ownership, hosting, and management of its own registry. UNDP’s role is to support countries with knowledge transfer and technical assistance.",
  "faqQ5": "What technical assistance can UNDP provide?",
  "faqA5": "Technical support for the deployment of the Climate Transparency Digital Toolbox can be provided as part of UNDP’s Readiness Assistance for Carbon Markets, under UNDP's Climate Promise framework, and following the guidelines of the High-Integrity Carbon Markets Initiative (subject to availability and agreement). National governments can request support through your national UNDP country office.",
  "faqQ6": "What if the Registry features do not work for my country?",
  "faqA6": "The Registry is designed to be fully customizable. Countries typically start each process by defining their countries’ needs and determining what needs to be changed from the demo system. Countries have already adapted the platform to fit a wide variety of contexts, including:<ul><li>The process flow of project registration, authorisation, monitoring, issuance </li><li>User roles and permissions </li><li>Approval authorities </li><li>Documentation requirements and forms</li><li>Data requirements (data fields)</li><li>Serial number formatting  </li><li>API Integration</li><li>Types of carbon market mechanisms supported</li><li>Advanced AI functionality </li><li>Data Hosting & Security protocols</li></ul>",
  "faqQ7": "Where will the data hosted?",
  "faqA7": "Countries are responsible for hosting and maintaining their Registry. Three primary hosting options countries have considered include:<ul><li><b>Cloud Hosting</b><br/>Offers scalability, integrated security, and ease of backup and maintenance. Hosting on AWS (via a government-owned account) allows countries to fully leverage QLDB with minimal configuration changes.</li><li><b>Local Hosting</b><br/>Countries can choose to install the software on government-managed servers or preferred cloud platforms to maintain full control over data, access, and security. Local IT teams will be responsible for ongoing maintenance, configuration, and backups.</li><li><b>Blockchain Integration</b><br/>Countries may opt to integrate blockchain-based encryption and distributed storage to enhance security and traceability.</li></ul>",
  "faqQ8": "Is the source code free to use?",
  "faqA8": "Yes. The Registry is developed by UNDP and licensed under the <b>GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL-3.0)</b>. This license allows:<ul><li>Free use, customization, and redistribution</li><li>Mandatory publication of any modifications to a public GitHub repository</li><li>No relicensing under more restrictive term</li></ul><b>Note:</b> If your team adapts the code, you are required to publish relevant updated code as a branch on GitHub in compliance with the license (after removing all sensitive, identifiable information). <br/><br/>📩 Let us know if you’re using the tool: <a1>digital4planet@undp.org</a1>",
  "faqQ9": "Will contributing code back to GitHub risk the National Registry’s cybersecurity?",
  "faqA9": "No. Project teams can share new feature improvements without disclosing sensitive details, such as by removing or anonymising all sensitive information including:<ul><li>Domain names</li><li>Port numbers</li><li>API endpoints</li><li>Usernames</li><li>Database names, locations</li><li>And any other sensitive information</li></ul>This ensures transparency in software development while protecting national infrastructure.",
