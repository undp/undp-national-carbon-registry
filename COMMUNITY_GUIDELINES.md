# Community Guidelines

Participation in the **National Carbon Credit Registry** community is governed by these guidelines.  Our aim is to foster an open, inclusive and productive environment where everyone feels welcome and respected.

## Joining the Conversation

When joining a conversation for the first time, please introduce yourself by sharing:

- Your organisation or affiliation (if applicable);
- Your pronouns; and
- Your “superpower” and how you hope to use it for the registry.

## Be Respectful and Inclusive

- Embrace a culture of learning.  There are no silly questions and everyone is at a different point in their journey.
- Take space and give space.  Ensure everyone has an opportunity to contribute.  If you tend to speak a lot, make room for others; if you are usually quiet, know that your input is valued.
- Be present and engaged in meetings and conversations.  If you join a synchronous chat, please participate.
- Be respectful.  Disagreement is natural but personal attacks or disrespectful language are not tolerated.
- Default to positive intent.  Assume others are acting in good faith and that contributions are made with the best intentions.

## Code of Conduct

All participants must adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  Instances of unacceptable behaviour may be reported to the project maintainers using the contact information provided in the code of conduct.

## How to Contribute

For practical guidance on how to propose changes, report issues or submit pull requests, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).  That document explains how to build the project locally, describes our workflow and branching model, and outlines expectations for tests and documentation.

## Governance and Roles

Details on project roles, responsibilities and decision‑making processes are provided in [COMMUNITY.md](COMMUNITY.md).  Maintainers and approvers oversee contributions and releases, while reviewers provide feedback on proposed changes.

## Acknowledgements

These guidelines were adapted from the United States Digital Service Justice40 project and the Contributor Covenant community.  We thank these communities for their leadership in fostering inclusive and respectful open‑source projects.
