# Security and Responsible Disclosure Policy

UNDP is committed to ensuring the security of the DPG users by protecting their information from unwarranted disclosure. We want security researchers to feel comfortable reporting vulnerabilities they have discovered so we can fix them and keep our users safe. We developed our disclosure policy to reflect our values and uphold our sense of responsibility to security researchers who share their expertise with us in good faith.

*Submit a vulnerability:* Vulnerability reports can be submitted via email by reaching out to one of the maintainers of this repository. Reports may be submitted anonymously. If you share contact information, we will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days.
