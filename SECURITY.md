# Security and Responsible Disclosure Policy

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is committed to ensuring the security of the American public by protecting their information from unwarranted disclosure. We want security researchers to feel comfortable reporting vulnerabilities they have discovered so we can fix them and keep our users safe. We developed our disclosure policy to reflect our values and uphold our sense of responsibility to security researchers who share their expertise with us in good faith.
